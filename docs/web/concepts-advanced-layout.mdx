## Implicit Binding

In previous layout examples, layouts were shown where components related to a map, such as zoom buttons, were nested within a map. It was assumed that the component would bind to the map it was placed in, but why?

```xml
    <map config="map1" slot="main">
      <stack margin="0.5" slot="bottom-right" halign="end">
        <zoom margin="0.8"/>
        <geolocate id="geolocator" margin="0.5" config="geolocate" />
      </stack>
    </map>
```

Certain components, such as `<zoom/>` or `<geolocate/>`, require a `<map/>` to function properly. To locate a `<map/>`, the component will crawl up the layout tree looking for a `<map/>` element. If none are found, then it will start a breadth first search at the root of the tree for the first `<map/>` component it finds.

Take this more complicated layout for example.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <split resizable="true" width="26">
        <map id="map1" config="map1" slot="main">
            <iwtm config="iwtm" id="IWTM" slot="top-right"/>
            <stack margin="0.5" slot="bottom-right" halign="end">
                <zoom margin="0.5"/>
                <button config="measureAction" icon="measure" style="map-widget" margin="0.5"/>
                <geolocate id="geolocator" margin="0.5" config="geolocate" />
            </stack>
        </map>

        <panel id="search-panel">
            <stack id="search">
                <search config="search"/>
                <results-list config="results" active="false" />
            </stack>
            <feature-details config="feature-details"/>
        </panel>
    </split>
</layout>
```

This layout has a `<search>` component which requires the context of a specific map to function. However, this component is **not** nested within the `<map/>` component in the app. Therefore, it will start a breadth first search from the root of the layout to discover a map component and bind to it.

:::note
This implicit binding logic also applies to [models](concepts-layout.mdx#models). If a corresponding `models` property is found before a corresponding component during the layout traversal, the `models` property will be bound to instead. For the above example, adding a `models="#map1"` attribute to the panel containing the `<search>` component would be a flexible solution to bind it to the correct map.

```xml
<panel id="search-panel" models="#map1">
```

### Implicit Config Binding

Most components support the [`config` attribute](concepts-app-config.mdx#linking-layout-to-app-config), which links a component to configuration in the `app.json`. However, some configuration types have a **default** value. This means that if you omit the `config` property for a component of that type, the component will attempt to create default config for the type. An example of defining default config can be seen in the `_getSerializableProperties` method of the model created for [this use case](usecases-implement-component-participate-app-config.mdx#participating-in-the-configuration-lifecycle). It's the mechanism that powers the default map for this layout.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <map id="myMap">
        <zoom padding="0.5" slot="top-left"/>
    </map>
</layout>
```
