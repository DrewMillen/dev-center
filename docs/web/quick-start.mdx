If the built in configurability of Geocortex Web does not serve your purposes, then it might be time to dive into the Geocortex Web SDK. Building applications on top of the Geocortex Web SDK requires enaging in the development, testing, and deployment of a custom application, so it's worthwhile to make sure your problem cannot be solved [with workflow or other advanced configuration](overview.mdx#start-with-your-use-case).

If you still think you need to use the Geocortex Mobile SDK, then lets get started!

## Overview

The Geocortex SDK is meant to be a local development enviroment for building custom [components](implement-component-with-ui.mdx), [services](implement-service.mdx), and more. Once the custom code has been developed, it can then be manually deployed to a SaaS or on premise enviroment.

## Requirements

-   The latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
    -   Run `node -v` in the terminal to confirm the version.
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) which is included with Node.

## Getting Up and Running

1. Run `npx @vertigis/web-sdk@alpha create <your-app-name>`
1. Open the `your-app-name` folder in your favorite IDE. We recommend using Visual Studio Code for the best experience.
1. Run `npm start` to start the development server

## Anatomy of the Quick Start

The created Web SDK Application is composed of two components:

1. The `src` folder, which contains your custom code.
2. The `app` folder, which contains a minimal [application](concepts-key-concepts.mdx) layout and config. This layout and config is meant to be used for testing your custom code before deployment.

The created application uses the [webpack development server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/), so just edit the layout, config, or custom code and the development server will automatically refresh and show your changes.

## Development Patterns

TODO - restructure hard

If you are developing custom code that is mostly independent of app context, it is suggested that you use the minimal layout and app config with only the required components.

If you need to develop custom code that requires the context of a custom application built in Geocortex Web Designer, take the following steps to import your SaaS or on premise application into your local Web SDK enviroment.

1. Open your application in Geocortex Web Designer.
1. [Download the application configuration](https://docs.geocortex.com/webviewer/latest/admin-help/Default.htm#gwv/download-app-configuration.htm).
1. Delete the contents of the `app` folder.
1. Extract the contents to you in your Web SDK Applications `app` folder, overwriting existing app config and layout.
1. Develop your custom code on top of your existing application.
