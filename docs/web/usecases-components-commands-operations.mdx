When writing custom components you may want to take advantage of Geocortex Web's large [built in suite of command and operations](api-commands-operations.mdx) or your own [custom commands and operations](usecases-implement-command-operation.mdx).

By the end of this article, you'll have the knowledge to build a custom component that can run commands and operations, as well as register implementations for them.

## Prerequisites

Check out [implementing a custom component](usecases-implement-component-with-ui.mdx) to learn the basics of implementing components.

If you want to implement a command and operation in a component, it's suggested you check out [custom commands and operations](usecases-implement-command-operation.mdx#implement-the-custom-command-and-operation) first.

## Running Commands and Operations

You can run command and operations [through the `UIContext` of the component](sdk-ui-context.mdx).

### Example: Display a Confirmation Dialog to a User

The following example executes the `ui.confirm` operation through the UIContext. Calling a command or operation is as simple as retrieving it by name, providing the appropriate generic type for the command or operation, and then calling `execute` with the appropriate arguments.

:::note
In order to pass arguments to a command or operation, you have to use the correct type for the generic `command` or `operation` function call with the argument and output type for the command or operation. For example, `ui.confirm` takes in a `ConfirmOperationArgs` and returns a `boolean`, as seen in the [API docs](api-commands-operations.mdx#uiconfirm).

<Tabs
  defaultValue="component"
  values={[
    { label: 'Component', value: 'component', },
    { label: 'UI', value: 'ui', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="component">

```tsx title="src/components/CustomComponent/CustomComponent.tsx"
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { LayoutElement } from "@geocortex/web/components";
import { UIContext } from "@geocortex/web/ui";
import Button from "@geocortex/web/ui/button/Button";
import { ConfirmOperationArgs } from "@geocortex/viewer-framework/messaging/registry/ui";

export default function CustomComponent(props) {
    const { operation, command } = useContext(UIContext);

    const displayConfirmDialog = async () => {
        const result = await operation<ConfirmOperationArgs, boolean>(
            "ui.confirm"
        ).execute({
            title: "Confirm Me",
        });

        if (result) {
            console.log("I have been confirmed!");
        } else {
            console.warn("I was not confirmed.");
        }
    };
    return (
        <LayoutElement {...props}>
            <Button onClick={displayConfirmDialog}>
                Display Confirm Dialog
            </Button>
        </LayoutElement>
    );
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ui">
<img src={useBaseUrl("img/web-display-notification.png")}/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Implementing Commands and Operations

Components can also register an implementation for any command. This allows for multiple actions to occur on a command execution, and a tighter coupling of command implementation to the UI.

### Example: Component that Implements a Command

When registering a command implementation for a component, it's best practice to register the implementation in the [components model](concepts-components-services.mdx#component-models-and-configuration). The following component model registers an implementation for a custom command that takes a `string` argument.

:::tip
If necessary, a component could also register the command implementation through the [UIContext](sdk-ui-context.mdx).
:::

```tsx
import { ComponentModelBase, serializable } from "@geocortex/web/models";

@serializable
export default class CustomModel extends ComponentModelBase {
    private _handles: IHandle[] = [];

    protected async _onInitialize(): Promise<void> {
        await super._onInitialize();

        this._handles.push(
            this.messages
                .command<string>("custom.my-command")
                .register((arg: string) => {
                    console.log(
                        `Executing 'custom.my-command' with argument '${arg}'`
                    );
                    return;
                })
        );
    }

    destroy(): void {
        super.destroy();

        // Clean up event handlers.
        this._handles.forEach((h) => h.remove());
    }
}
```
