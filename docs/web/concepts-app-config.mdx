:::note Before learning about app config...
Check out the [Key Concepts](concepts-key-concepts.mdx).
:::

While [layouts](concepts-layout.mdx) depict the visual structure of how components are going to appear in the viewer, **app config** is used to define the functional structure within a given component.

-   Think of the app config as the structural materials for building a house (wood, bricks, etc.) and the layout as the blueprints for the house.

-   The materials are the fundamental building blocks that create the house itself, and the blueprints allow for them to be structured together into something that people can interact with.

Every component within the viewer that requires functional, compositional content needs to be configured within the viewer's corresponding app config.

## Anatomy of an App config.

An app config file is composed of a list of **app items**.

## Linking Layout to App Config

Every component in the layout can be linked to app config with the `config` attribute. The `config` attribute is used to identify the item in the app config that has configuration for the component.

:::note
If you do not provide a `config` attribute for a component, Geocortex Web will attempt to [infer a default value](concepts-advanced-layout.mdx#implicit-config-binding).
:::

<Tabs
  defaultValue="layout"
  values={[
    { label: "layout", value: "layout" },
    { label: "app config", value: "config" },
  ]}>
<TabItem value="layout">

```xml
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <map id="map-primary"/>
</layout>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="config">

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "$type": "map-extension",
            "id": "default",
            "webMap": "7e5d9cf959e149af95bb01be8b62c107"
        }
    ]
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The same config can be used for multiple items in a layout. For example, this allows you to reuse the same button in multiple locations in the App.

TODO - example once I figure out the best way to edit default layout and app config

## Targeting Components with by ID

Every component can also have an `id` attribute. The `id` attribute uniquely identifies a component within a layout and allows app items to target the component. The id can be used by [commands](concepts-commands-operations.mdx) like `ui.activate` to target components, or by commands like `run.workflow` to target a host container component to display workflow UI within.

TODO - write demo and reword above paragraph if neccesary once layout/config access is figured out

:::note
This example uses [commands and operation](concepts-commands-operations.mdx) to power it's behaviour.
