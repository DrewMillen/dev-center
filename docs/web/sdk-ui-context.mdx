[Custom components](usecases-implement-component-with-ui.mdx) often need to access the application context to run [commands and operations](concepts-commands-operations), subscribe and publish to [events](concepts-events), and more. A component has two ways of accessing the application context.

First, every component has a [model](usecases-implement-component-participate-app-config.mdx#component-models) which in turn has a [`MessageBus`](api-message-bus.mdx) that can be used to access commands, operations, and events. All application context interactions can be facilitated by the model.

Optionally, a component can use the `UIContext` to access commands, operations and events.

## Injecting the UIContext

The `UIContext` is injected into a component with the [React `useContext` hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext). 

```tsx
import { UIContext } from "@geocortex/web/ui";

export default function CustomComponent(props) {
    const { command, operation, event } = useContext(UIContext);
    ...
}
```

Once the context is injected, you can access it's properties and interact with the application context in your custom component.
