The Geocortex Web SDK Framework allows you to extend the functionality of a Geocortex Web application with custom development. There are three main extension points in the framework:

#### Components

Components power the UI experience of Geocortex Web. Components are composed of a React Component and a backing data model. Layout files are composed of a nested hierarchy of components which are instantiated at runtime.

#### Services

Services provide the shared infrastructure and core logic that power app behavior. Services do not have an associated UI, and there is only one instance of a service per application.

#### Commands and Operations

Commands and operations provide a framework for executing app wide behavior. Services and components can both run and implement commands and operations, allowing for interaction and consistent behavior without tight coupling.

<!-- TODO-API links to components -->

In general, these three elements interact to form a Geocortex Web Application.

-   Services are used to implement app wide behavior, such as theming or authentication, and then expose that logic through commands and operations, such as `ui.set-theme` (implemented by the `BrandingService`) or `auth.sign` (implemented by the `AuthenticationService`).
-   Components run commands and operations to interact with global concerns, but can also implement a command or operation if they are responsible for a global concern, or need to facilitate interaction with another component or service.
-   Component and service interaction through commands and operations is preferred, but components and services can also be tightly coupled to each other through [model injection](TODO-model-injection-link) or [service injection](TODO-service-injection-link)
