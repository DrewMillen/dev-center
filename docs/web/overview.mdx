Geocortex Web is a next-generation framework for creating sleek and effective GIS applications for a wide variety of browsers. Apps allow users to view and interact with web-based maps and associated data. Geocortex Web can seamlessly display both 2D and 3D map data. Integration with [Geocortex Workflow](../workflow/overview.mdx) ensures that you can build apps for many business processes. Geocortex Web is part of the [Geocortex suite of products](https://www.geocortex.com/products/).

Geocortex Web apps are created, configured and deployed with [Geocortex Web Designer](https://apps.geocortex.com/webviewer/designer/). Web Designer is an intuitive web application that displays a live preview of Geocortex Web apps as they are being configured.
