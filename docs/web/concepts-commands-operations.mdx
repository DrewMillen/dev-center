:::note Before learning about commands and operations...
Check out the [Key Concepts](concepts-key-concepts.mdx).
:::

**Commands and operations** are runnable, independent units of work within Geocortex Web. Using the Geocortex Web SDK, it's possible to [define custom commands and operations](usecases-implement-command-operation.mdx) for use throughout the application. Commands are units of work which may take an input but do not produce an output, and operations differ because they produce output. Commands and Operations are grouped by namespace, for example:

```
auth.sign-in
auth.sign-out
edit.add-feature
edit.delete-features
```

TODO - flesh out

## Next Steps

Geocortex Web has a large array of built-in command and operations that you can chain to power custom behavior. Custom commands and operations can also be implemented with the SDK.
