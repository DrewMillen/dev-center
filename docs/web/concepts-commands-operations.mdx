:::note Before learning about commands and operations...
Check out the [Key Concepts](concepts-key-concepts.mdx).
:::

**Commands and operations** are runnable, independant units of work within Geocortex Web. Using the Geocortex Web SDK, it's possible to [define custom commands and operations](usecases-implement-command-operation.mdx) for use throughout the application. Commands are units of work which may take an input but do not produce an output, and operations differ because they produce output. Commands and Operations are grouped by namespace, for example;

```
auth.sign-in
auth.sign-out
edit.add-feature
edit.delete-features
```

[Components or Services](concepts-components-services.mdx) are usually responsible for registering a command or operation implementation with Geocortex Web. Once a command or operation has been registered, it can be used from anywhere in the application. [Custom Commands and Operations](usecases-implement-command-operation.mdx) are registered with custom services or custom components in this manner.

### Argument Passing

Commands and Operations are most commonly used to configure the behavior of components. For example, here's configuration for the `featureActions` and `onFeatureClick` behaviours of a `<results-list>` component.

```json
({
    "id": "results-list",
    "featureActions": [
        "item://menu-item/zoom",
        "item://menu-item/save-features-to-csv"
    ],
    "onFeatureClick": "results.display-details",
    "$type": "results"
},
{
    "id": "zoom",
    "iconId": "zoom-feature",
    "title": "language-designer-gen-zoom-to-results-menuitemtitle",
    "description": "language-designer-gen-zoom-to-results-menuitemdescription",
    "action": ["map.zoom-to-features", "highlights.pulse"],
    "$type": "menu-item"
},
{
    "id": "save-features-to-csv",
    "iconId": "csv-export",
    "title": "language-designer-gen-export-features-to-csv-menuitemtitle",
    "description": "language-designer-gen-export-features-to-csv-menuitemdescription",
    "action": ["results.convert-to-csv", "system.download-file"],
    "$type": "menu-item"
})
```

App config properties that accept a command or operation can take a single operation (such as with the `onFeatureClick` on the `results-list`) or they can take a **command chain** (such as with the `action` property on `save-features-to-csv`).

:::note
Command chains are arrays of commands and operations which are executed sequentially. The output of previous operations is passed along the chain to future operations, allowing for complex input dependent behavior.
:::

Since these commands and operations are running from the [context](https://docs.geocortex.com/webviewer/latest/admin-help/Default.htm#gwv/add-a-workflow-to-an-app.htm#use-the-menu-context-as-a-workflow-input) of a `<results-list>` component, the first command or operation will receive the relevant feature as it's input. If the property is a command chain, the next behavior in line will receive one of two possible inputs.

1. If the previous behavior was a command (which doesn't produce output), then the original input is passed on to the next behavior.
2. If the previous behavior was an operation (which produces an output), then the output of that operation is passed onto the next behavior.

Since these commands and operations are running from the [context](https://docs.geocortex.com/webviewer/latest/admin-help/Default.htm#gwv/add-a-workflow-to-an-app.htm#use-the-menu-context-as-a-workflow-input) of a Feature Details component, the first command or operation will receive the relevant feature as it's input. If the property is a command chain, the next behavior in line will receive one of two possible inputs.

1. If the previous behavior was a command (which doesn't produce output), then the original input is passed on to the next behavior.
2. If the previous behavior was an operation (which produces an output), then the output of that operation is passed onto the next behavior.

In this way, you can run multiple commands in a row that receive a feature as input, as seen in the `action` command chain of `zoom-feature` in the example.

```json
["map.zoom-to-features", "highlights.pulse"]
```

The `action` command chain of `save-features-to-csv` demonstrates how an operation can pass it's output to the next command or operation in the list. In this case, it's passing the csv content to `system.download-file`.

```json
["results.convert-to-csv", "system.download-file"]
```

### Passing Named Arguments

If you choose, you can overide the default arguments passed into a command or operation by provide an `arguments` property.

```json
{
    "$type": "menu",
    "id": "iwtm",
    "items": [
        {
            "title": "Hello",
            "isEnabled": true,
            "iconId": "info",
            "action": {
                "name": "ui.display-notification",
                "arguments": {
                    "message": "World"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

<!-- TODO-After-API change autocomplete linting note to API definitions -->

<!-- TODO - something about how to discover what the named arguments are for each command in web? what's our pattern? -->

This will override the default arugment passing behavior for that command or operation. For example, `ui.display-notification` takes a object of type `DisplayNotificationArgs`, which has the property `message` of type `string`.

<!-- TODO - UI -->

This example demonstrates two different types of argument passing behavior. The first action in the app config is a command chain defined on the `onClick` property of a map. This chain consists of four operations and commands:

-   `task.identify`,
-   `highlights.add-focus`
-   `results.display`

`tasks.identify` does not have any named arguments defined, so it will take arguments passed into it from it's current [context](https://docs.geocortex.com/webviewer/latest/admin-help/Default.htm#gwv/add-a-workflow-to-an-app.htm#use-the-menu-context-as-a-workflow-input). Since this chain is run on a map click, the context argument passed in has the shape

```json
{
  "geometry": "Esri.Point(<map-click-location>)",
  ... <other props>
}
```

<!-- TODO - tasks.identify operation direct link -->

`tasks.identify` receives this argument, and since it is an operation, produces an output. Looking at the [Commands and Operations Documentation](api-commands-operations.mdx), `tasks.identify` has output with the shape

```json
{
  "features": [<feature1>, <feature2>, ...],
  "results": [<Result(feature1)>, <Result(feature2)>, ...],
  ... <other props>
}
```

`highlights.add-focus`, `results.display` both take an input object with a "features" property, so the output of `tasks.identify` will work nicely. `highlights.add-focus` is immediately after `tasks.identify`, so it receives the output of identify. Since `highlights.add-focus` is a command, it does not produce any output. `results.display` will receive the output of the last operation (or the original input if no operations have run), so it will also receive the output of `tasks.identify`. In this way, you can pass the output of an operation to multiple commands.

:::

The second command/operation in this application is a `map.zoom-to-initial-viewpoint` command on the I Want To Menu. This command takes a [MapExtensionArgs](TODO-API-Link), which is provided as a named argument. The `maps` property in the argument references the `default`map in the config through an **Item Uri**. Item URI's are a way of referencing other items within the app config. See [Item URI's](concepts-advanced-config.mdx#item-uris-and-resource-uris) for more details.

Geocortex Web has a large array of built in command and operations that you can chain to power custom behavior. Custom commands and operations can also be implemented with the SDK.
