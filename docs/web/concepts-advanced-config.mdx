## Item URIs

**Item URI's** are a commonly used pattern in the `app.json` to uniquely identify and reference app items. They take the format

`item://<item-type>/<item-id>`

For example, the item URI for the following item is `item://menu-item/measureAction`

```json
{
  "$type": "menu",
  "id": "feature-actions",
  "items": [...]
}
```

These item URI's can be used by app items to include other app items as property values, allowing reuse.

```json
{
    "$type": "feature-details",
    "id": "feature-details",
    "featureActions": "item://menu/feature-actions"
}
```

## Custom App Items

Custom App items in Geocortex Web are most commonly defined by creating a  configurable [component models](usecases-implement-component-participate-app-config.mdx#component-models) or [configurable services](usecases-implement-service#example-configurable-service). Registering the model or service with Geocortex Web defines a new app item type which can be uses in the app config.
