Events are distinct, discrete messaging about a change or update that occurs in the viewer. They can be published or subscribed to by any component, service or view registered with Mobile, and can be used to initiate behaviours, communicate data changes, and more. Events themselves do not execute behaviour, but merely provide messaging so subscribers can act on changes.

Events in Mobile are grouped by category

```
app.activated
app.backgrounded
geolocation.position-changed
geolocation.position-lost
```

Events can publish custom arguments with information about the change they are communicating. The full list of existing events available in mobile can be [found in the API](/docs/mobile/api/events). 

## Usage

Events are internal to the Mobile SDK, so they can only be consumed by custom code. Once defined, any [Custom Component](/docs/mobile/use-cases/implement-component-with-ui) or [Custom Service](/docs/mobile/use-cases/implement-background-service) can publish or subscribe to custom events.
