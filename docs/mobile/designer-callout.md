:::note Have you explored the Mobile Designer?
The [Geocortex Mobile Designer](https://apps.geocortex.com/mobileviewer/designer/) allows you to edit an applications layout, attach custom behaviours to buttons and other UI components, show custom forms and act on their submission through the use of [Workflow](/docs/workflow/overview). Many problems can be solved through the designer and don't require custom development.
