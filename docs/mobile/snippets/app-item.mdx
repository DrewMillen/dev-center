:::note
App items can potentially be anything; they represent a type of item that the viewer is aware of and knows how to locate and load. In respect to Mobile, they usually they represent configuration for components, maps, portal items, or shared data. All item app configuration is specified within the `items` array of the **`app.json`** file.
