### Geocortex Mobile SDK Packages

The Geocortex Mobile SDK is composed of Geocortex packages:

-   `Geocortex Icons`
    -   This package provides configurable vector icons for use in Geocortex Mobile apps.
-   `Geocortex Mobile`
    -   This package is the heart of the Mobile SDK, and powers the interface and interactions of a Mobile Xamarin Application.
    -   This package includes the Geocortex.API namespace, an API for working with foundational Geocortex models, configuration, Esri's ArcGIS types, etc.
-   `Geocortex Workflow`
    -   Geocortex Mobile heavily relies on [Geocortex Workflow](../workflow/overview.mdx) to power it's functionality.
    -   Geocortex Workflow is itself composed of many packages (Image Activities, Forms, GIS, Runtime).
-   `Geocortex Viewer Framework`
    -   This package provides the definitions of [layout](concepts-layout.mdx) and [app config](concepts-app-config.mdx) that are central to every Mobile app.
