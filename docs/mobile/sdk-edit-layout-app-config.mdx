## Editing the Layout and App Config

Many changes to Geocortex Mobile will require editing the layout and app config for your custom application. The app config and layout files are contained in the shared platform agnostic project. Each platform specific project links to these files as an asset or a reference, so editing the files in the platform agnostic project will change them for all platforms. Check out [layout](concepts-layout.mdx) and [app config](concepts-app-config.mdx) to learn more about configuring Geocortex Mobile with these files.
