## Development Patterns

For the most part, the Geocortex Mobile project follows the development practices outlined in [Enterprise Application Patterns using Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/enterprise-application-patterns/).

One major deviation from usual Xamarin Development patterns is that [Autofac](https://autofac.org/) is used as the Dependency Injection framework.

## Deployment

The Quickstart provided is a standard Xamarin forms application, and can be deployed in accordance to [Xamarin's guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/deploy-test/).

## Entry Points

Each platform has platform specific setup and an entry point, after which they all boostrap the application through the platform agnostic project. In the platform agnostic project, the `OnStart` method of `App.cs` calls the Geocortex Mobile SDK Bootstrapper, and loads and displays the application with the given `app.json` configuration.

#### Android

The `OnCreate` method of the `MainActivity.cs` file in the Android specific project handles Android specific setup.

#### iOS

The `FinishedLaunching` method of the `AppDelegate.cs` in the iOS specific project handles iOS specific setup.

#### Universal Windows

The constructors of the `App.xaml.cs` and `MainPage.xaml.cs` files in the UWP specific project handles Windows specific setup.

## Error Handling

In each of the platform specific setups, there is a call to the `HandleExceptions` method. This method tells Geocortex Mobile to handle exceptions and display an Error. If you need to have control over global error handling, you can remove the call to `HandleExceptions` and implement your own global exception handling for the Xamarin Application. [This Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39503390/global-exception-handling-in-xamarin-cross-platform) is a good starting point for implementating global error handling.

## Referencing Third Party Libraries

The Geocortex Mobile Quickstart is simply a [.NET Xamarin Forms project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/Quickstarts/deepdive?pivots=windows) so you can add dependencies to it like any other .NET project.

:::caution
However, the Geocortex Mobile SDK relies on exact versions of [ArcGIS Runtime](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcgis-runtime/) and [Xamarin Forms](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms) NuGet packages.

## Next Steps

The Quickstart is a useful starting point for your custom Geocortex Mobile application. Build on top of it by following along with a [use case](usecases-implement-command-operation.mdx), or check out the [SDK Samples](https://github.com/geocortex/vertigis-mobile-samples) for inspiration and examples of what you can accomplish with the Geocortex Mobile SDK.
